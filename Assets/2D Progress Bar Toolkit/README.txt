The code above creates a class called "CircularProgressBar" which inherits from the "MonoBehaviour" class. This class is used to create a circular progress bar UI element in a Unity game or application. The class uses Unity's UI system to create and manipulate the elements of the progress bar.

The class has several SerializeField variables that can be set in the Unity editor, including the main color and fill color of the progress bar, the number of segments in the progress bar, the start and end angles of the progress bar, the size of the notches between segments, and the fill amount of the progress bar.

In the "Awake" function, the script gets the main Image component of the progress bar, sets its color and deactivates it, then calculates the size of each segment and creates a new Image component for each segment, positioning and rotating them based on the start angle, size of segment and size of notch. Then it also creates a list of fill images, which will be used to fill each segment and change the color of fill image to the fillColor.

In the "Update" function, the script updates the fill amount of each segment based on the overall fill amount and the size of each segment.

The class also includes two helper functions, "NormalizeAngle" and "ConvertCircleFragmentToAngle", which are used to convert angles to a normalized value between 0 and 1, and to convert a value representing a fraction of the total circumference of a circle to an angle in degrees, respectively.
